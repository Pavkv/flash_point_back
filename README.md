## 📌 Description

The back-end is a Node.js and Express-based RESTful API that supports a React front-end application by providing the following functionality:

• Handles user registration and login with secure password hashing and JWT-based authentication
• Allows authenticated users to save and delete articles in their personal collection
• Stores user data and saved articles in a MongoDB database using Mongoose schemas
• Fetches and formats news articles from the NewsAPI based on user queries
• Implements request validation using Celebrate and Joi for robust data handling
• Includes security and performance middleware such as Helmet, rate limiting, and CORS

The back-end is designed for scalability, secure data handling, and seamless integration with the front-end application.
